âœ“ In order to get my friend I will follow the next steps:
1. I start by picking a direction and driving in that direction on the highway. 
Let's assume I choose to go forward initially.

2. Then I drive for a predetermined distance or time interval, ensuring that I
can easily return to my starting point if needed. This distance or time 
interval should be reasonable and allow me to cover a substantial portion of 
the highway.

3. After reaching the predetermined distance or time interval, I turn around 
and start driving in the opposite direction, heading back towards my original 
starting point on the highway.

4. Then I Drive for the same distance or time interval in the opposite direction 
from step 2.

5. Finally Repeating steps 2 to 4 until I find my friend's car. Each time i
complete a round trip (forward and backward), I will double the distance or 
time interval before turning around.
